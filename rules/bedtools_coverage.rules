# todo: tweak overlap to be comparable with bin by sam edge cases
# I'm thinking of doing this with -F option: minimum overlap required as a fraction of B
# and having the minimum overlap fraction be 0.5, i.e., at least half of the read must
# align to the bin at hand for it to be counted. Unlikely to affect that many reads, especially
# in low coverage data.
