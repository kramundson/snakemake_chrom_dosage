# I divided this into two snakefiles. For reasons I don't understand, the function
# get_region_gvcfs in the main Snakefile requires that all files it tries to open
# already exist. It won't catch that these files are being made during the job.

# init_genome.snakes handles initiation of reference genome file dependencies, including
# reference genome download, fasta index and fasta dictionary creation, generation of
# intervals to operate on in parallel, and files of output filenames for the subsequent
# analysis steps. 

# init_genome.snakes should be run before trying to run the main Snakefile.
# At the command line, run init_genome.snakes as follows:
# snakemake -s init_genome.snakes

# Once init_genome.snakes finishes running, run the main analysis on a cluster
# with the following command:
# sbatch runSnakes.slurm
